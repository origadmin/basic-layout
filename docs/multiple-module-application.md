## 2. Multiple Module Application (`multiple/multiple_sample`)

A multi-module backend project example based on the [Kratos](https://go-kratos.dev/) framework, demonstrating how to
build and manage multiple services within a single Go module.

This project serves as a template for creating a standalone Go application with multiple interconnected services. It
depends on several public `origadmin` packages (like `runtime` and `toolkits`), which are managed as standard Go module
dependencies.

### ✨ Features

* **Kratos v2**: Built upon the latest Kratos framework.
* **Standard Go Modules**: Manages all dependencies through `go.mod`.
* **Multi-Module Monorepo**: Contains three independent services (`user`, `order`, `gateway`) within a single repository
  structure.
* **Microservice Ready**: Provides a clear path for splitting the monorepo into multiple independent microservice
  repositories.
* **API Gateway**: The `gateway` service acts as a unified entry point, routing requests to `user` and `order` services.
* **Code Generation & Publishing**: Integrated with `buf` and `GoReleaser`.
* **Makefile**: Provides convenient `make` commands for development workflows.
