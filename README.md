# Basic Layout Examples

This directory contains example projects demonstrating different application layouts using the OrigAdmin framework.
These examples serve as practical guides and starting points for building your own applications, showcasing two common
architectural patterns: a standard single-module microservice and a multi-module monorepo, along with guidance on
evolving from one to the other.

## Projects

1. [**simple/simple_app**](./simple/simple_app): A standard single-module application.
2. [**multiple/multiple_sample**](./multiple/multiple_sample): A multi-module application within a single project
   boundary, featuring `user`, `order`, and `gateway` services.
